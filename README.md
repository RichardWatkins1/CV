## Richard Watkins

A person who has many interests and is always seeking new challenges, this mindset has driven my to take the decision to change careers and undergo an intensive bootcamp at Maker's Academy learning software development through agile practices. The intensive 3 months has seen me develop both my growth mindset and my programming skills by building complex projects in a short amount of time (usually 1 or 2 weeks). 

I'm looking for a company that embodies agile practices such and pairing and the XP values as this is something I particuarly enjoyed over the course and look forward to taking on in my career, I'm also looking for an environment where I can continue to learn and grow as the desire to continue to learn new skills was a key component of my decision to change careers.

##Skills

#### Fast Learner

Constantly try to embody a growth mindset and find opportunites to learn new skills. I love to take on new challenges and I'm not afraid of having no experience in the area.

- Built multiple projects in various different languages throughout the Makers Academy course.
- Managed deadlines and workflow using new tools and XP values.
- As part of a team of 4 built Do-ocracy a website that allows large complicated projects to be managed and controlled by the members themselves in order to reduce bureaucracy through an open source approach. http://doocracy.herokuapp.com/.

#### Communication

Excellent communication skills as I previously worked as a Teacher of Science at a school ranked in the top 1% of schools national in terms of student progress. As a teacher the success and opportunities of the young people I taught depended on my ability to clearly communicate the skills and content required for their examinations.

- I achieved 'outstanding' results over several years, subjects and ability levels.
- I contributed to the development of my profession by mentoring student teachers (including pair lesson planning, observation feedback and reflection) and achieving becoming an 'outstanding' mentor from the Universtiy of Leeds. 
- I have embodied agile practices across the Makers Academy course such  as stand-ups, retros and pairing programming.

#### Teamwork

My previous career invloved both working in and managing a team and 15 Teachers that produced the best science results in the history of Rodillian Academy. Maker's Acadmey also allows several opportunities to work in teams and manage workflow in an agile way and this is something I'm looking for in my future employment.

- Pair programming and Agile methodologies at Makers Academy.
- Develop strong professional relationships. 
- Humble approach to decision making by respectfully communicating my opinions based on meritocracy.
