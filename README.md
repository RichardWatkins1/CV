## Richard Watkins

A person who has many interests and is always seeking new challenges, this mindset has driven my to take the decision to change careers and undergo an intensive bootcamp at Maker's Academy learning software development through agile practices. The intensive 3 months has seen me develop both my growth mindset and my programming skills by building complex projects in a short amount of time (usually 1 or 2 weeks). 

I'm looking for a company that embodies agile practices such and pairing and the XP values as this is something I particuarly enjoyed over the course and look forward to taking on in my career, I'm also looking for an environment where I can continue to learn and grow as the desire to continue to learn new skills was a key component of my decision to change careers.
