As a motivated and self-driven individual I’m always seeking new challenges. This led me to change careers from a science teacher at one of the UK’s top performing schools and learn to code.
 
A three month intensive course at Makers Academy taught me a range of technologies essential for web development as well as working to agile standards to code in real-world projects. Obtaining a job at a startup really helped me continue to develop and pick up a wide range of skills including building and maintaining scalable applications while giving me the experience of debugging and optimising production code. It has also given me the opportunity to work in a full stack environment and this is something I would like to continue.
 
I’m looking to continue to grow by working with like-minded individuals at a company which embodies modern practices and will support my passion for solving real world problems by building scalable, maintainable services.
