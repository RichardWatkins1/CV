As a motivated and self-driven individual I’m always seeking new challenges. This led me to change careers from a science teacher at one of the UK’s top performing schools and learn to code.

A three month intensive course at Makers Academy taught me HTML, JavaScript and Ruby as well as working to agile standards to code in real-world projects.

I’m looking to grow my knowledge by working with a like-minded company which embodies modern practices and will support my passion to develop and grow my knowledge.

#### Fast Learner

I constantly try to embody a growth mind-set and find opportunities to learn new skills. I love to take on new challenges and solve fresh exciting new problems.

- Built multiple projects in various different languages throughout the Makers Academy course.
- Managed deadlines and workflow using new tools and XP values.
- As part of a team of 4 built Do-ocracy a website that allows large complicated projects to be managed and controlled by the members themselves in order to reduce bureaucracy through an open source approach. http://doocracy.herokuapp.com/. This project combined all the skills that were learnt during the course include Rails, Rspec and postgresSQL.

#### Communication

Excellent communication skills as I previously worked as an Assistant Head of Science at a school ranked in the top 1% of schools nationally in terms of student progress. As a teacher, the success and opportunities of the young people I taught depended on my ability to clearly communicate the skills and content required for their examinations.

-	I achieved 'outstanding' results over several years, subjects and different ability levels.
-	I contributed to the development of my profession by mentoring student teachers (including pair lesson planning, observation feedback and reflection) and achieving ‘outstanding mentor’ from the University of Leeds.
-	I have embodied agile practices across the Makers Academy course such as stand-ups, retros and pairing programming.


#### Teamwork

My previous career involved both working in and managing a team of 15 Teachers that produced the best science results in the history of Rodillian Academy. Maker's Academy also allows several opportunities to work in teams and manage workflow in an agile way and this is something I'm looking for in my future employment.

- Pair programming and Agile methodologies at Makers Academy.
- Develop strong professional relationships.
- Humble approach to decision making by respectfully communicating my opinions based on meritocracy.
